    "This notebook will get you started with DifferentialEquations.jl by introducing you to the functionality for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The corresponding documentation page is the [ODE tutorial](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/getting_started/#ode_example). While some of the syntax may be different for other types of equations, the same general principles hold in each case. Our goal is to give a gentle and thorough introduction that highlights these principles in a way that will help you generalize what you have learned.\n",

However, a good rule of thumb is that the total solution accuracy is 1-2 digits less than the relative tolerances. Thus for the defaults `abstol=1e-6` and `reltol=1e-3`, you can expect a global accuracy of about 1-2 digits. If we want to get around 6 digits of accuracy, we can use the commands:"

When you call `solve(prob)`, DifferentialEquations.jl makes a guess at a good algorithm for your problem, given the properties that you ask for (the tolerances, the saving information, etc.). However, in many cases you may want more direct control. A later notebook will help introduce the various *algorithms* in DifferentialEquations.jl, but for now let's introduce the *syntax*.\n",

That's quite mathematical, and we can think of it more intuitively: if you have big numbers in `f` (like parameters of order `1e5`), then it's probably stiff. Or, as the creator of the MATLAB ODE Suite, Lawrence Shampine, likes to define it, if the standard algorithms are slow, then it's stiff. This is an extensive area of research, but for now note that if you believe your model may be stiff, you can hint this to the algorithm chooser via `alg_hints = [:stiff]`."

    "\n",
    "The last basic user-interface feature to explore is the choice of types. DifferentialEquations.jl respects your input types to determine the internal types that are used. Thus since in the previous cases, when we used `Float64` values for the initial condition, this meant that the internal values would be solved using `Float64`. We made sure that time was specified via `Float64` values, meaning that time steps would utilize 64-bit floats as well. But, by simply changing these types we can change what is used internally.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic controls in DifferentialEquations.jl. All equations are defined via a problem type, and the `solve` command is used with an algorithm choice (or the default) to get a solution. Every solution acts the same, like an array `sol[i]` with `sol.t[i]`, and also like a continuous function `sol(t)` with a nice plot command `plot(sol)`. The Common Solver Options can be used to control the solver for any equation type. Lastly, the types used in the numerical solving are determined by the input types, and this can be used to solve with arbitrary precision and add additional optimizations (this can be used to solve via GPUs for example!). While this was shown on ODEs, these techniques generalize to other types of equations as well."
